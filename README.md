# CS-320-Software-Test-Code-and-Reflection
Throughout these projects, I have focused on ensuring that my code, programs, and software are both functional and secure by consistently testing throughout the development process. I make use of unit tests, code reviews, and security checks to identify potential vulnerabilities early. Staying updated on best practices for coding standards and security protocols also helps me protect my software. When interpreting user needs, I prioritize communication and feedback. I carefully analyze user stories, gather requirements, and make sure that the program is intuitive and meets those needs. I understand that users may not always know exactly what they want, so it's important to ask clarifying questions and iterate based on their feedback. When approaching software design, I start by clearly defining the problem, brainstorming possible solutions, and planning out the systems architecture. I believe in building wireframes, flowcharts, and prototypes to visualize how the software will work before writing code. A strong design phase allows me to create software that is more scalable, maintainable, and aligned with user expectations.
